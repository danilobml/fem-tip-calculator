## Overview

### The challenge

This is my solution to the challenge. I'm learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript development. I'd really appreciate if anyone could review it and give me tips (especially in the Javascript parts), in how to do things better, perhaps in a simpler way. I love to learn, and I'm always open to feedback!

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a bit challenging. I am learning React and decided to go back to "vanilla" JavaScript for this project. I sense that I need to practice it much more, in order to get both ways of doing things solifdified, and I might have "overcomplicated" some things in the code. Sizing is also challenging for me. I'd appreciate any feedback or tips to improve.

### Continued development

I need to practice more styling, sizing and vanilla JS.
